Project 3 Semantics due 3/30/17 Thursday 11:59 PM (nearly midnight)

Project 3 is the construction of semantic analyzer. You are to include 
in your parser appropriate checking not included in the grammar, but 
defined by the language.

This is going to be the test of the quality of your symbol
table implemented during parsing. You are to determine and
implement appropriate checks as discussed.

Your project should be shar'd containing a makefile, source file,
doc file, and typescript (showing your testing). The makefile file
should be invoked with "make" creating an executable of p3. Your
project will be invoked with p3 fn where fn is the data file to be
analyzed. p3 is the executable resulting from the make command 
or is a script that executes your project. BE SURE TO PROVIDE BOTH A
MAKEFILE AND A P3 EXECUTABLE SCRIPT FOR YOUR PROJECT. Also, be sure
to test the integrity of your shar.

This project must be complete in that the lexical analyzer must be
included to create the tokens required by the parser and
semantic analyzer.

Your project should report on a single line without any additional
characters

ACCEPT

or 

REJECT

upon completion of the analysis.

Note that turnin will report the 2 day late date, if the project
is submitted on this date a penalty will be assessed.

Ensure your shar is properly constructed. 

Use turnin for submission as

turnin fn ree4620_3

where fn is the shar'd file of your complete project.

--------------------------

The following represents a set of tests that might be considered. The
list is not required, nor is it complete, but may be used as a goal
for semantic analysis.

functions declared int or float  must have a return value of the
   correct type.
void functions may or may not have a return, but must not return a
   value.
parameters and arguments agree in number
parameters and arguments agree in type
operand agreement
operand/operator agreement
array index agreement
variable declaration (all variables must be declared ... scope)
variable declaration (all variables declared once ... scope)
void functions cannot have a return value
each program must have one main function
return only simple structures
id's should not be type void
each function should be defined (actually a linker error)
